****** Hemisphere OSC MediaPlayer for Raspberry Pi ****** 


What is it
**********

HPlayer is a video and sound player for RaspberryPi controllable with OSC commands.
The player is build on top of OMXPlayer and OpenFrameworks,
so it is GPU accelerated and offers OpenGL Shaders and Textures support.
HPlayer is developped under the terms of GNU General Public License version 2.
You can find a copy of this license in the LICENSE file.


Installation from source
************************

HPlayer is based on
- OpenFrameworks 0.8.x ARMv6
- ofxOsc (now embedded with OF-0.8)
- ofxOMXPlayer from jvcleave
- ofxArgParser from satoruhiga

1. Download / Install OpenFrameworks ARMv6 from http://openframeworks.cc/download/
and unzip it somewhere like ~/openframeworks/ in the next steps, we'll call this path "$OF"
> cd 
> curl -O http://www.openframeworks.cc/versions/v0.8.1/of_v0.8.1_linuxarmv6l_release.tar.gz
> mkdir openFrameworks
> tar vxfz of_v0.8.1_linuxarmv6l_release.tar.gz -C openFrameworks --strip-components 1
> rm of_v0.8.1_linuxarmv6l_release.tar.gz
> cd ~/openFrameworks/scripts/linux/debian_armv6l
> sudo ./install_dependencies.sh
> make Release -C /home/pi/openFrameworks/libs/openFrameworksCompiled/project

2. Clone ofxOMXPlayer from https://github.com/jvcleave/ofxOMXPlayer into $OF/addons/
> cd ~/openFrameworks/addons/ && git clone https://github.com/jvcleave/ofxOMXPlayer.git

3. Clone ofxArgParser from https://github.com/satoruhiga/ofxArgParser into $OF/addons/
> cd ~/openFrameworks/addons/ && git clone https://github.com/satoruhiga/ofxArgParser.git

4. Clone project HPlayer into $OF/apps/myApps/
> cd ~/openFrameworks/apps/myApps/ 
> git clone https://github.com/Hemisphere-Project/HPlayer.git

5. You are now ready to compile the player.
> cd ~/openFrameworks/apps/myApps/HPlayer
> make

6. Once it's done, you can test it with "make run"
or copy the content of the bin/ directory to your usual binary path.
use ./HPlayer to start the player


Use it!
