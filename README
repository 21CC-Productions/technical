****** Hemisphere OSC MediaPlayer for Raspberry Pi ****** 


What is it
**********

HPlayer is a video and sound player for RaspberryPi controllable with OSC commands.
The player is build on top of OMXPlayer and OpenFrameworks,
it's GPU accelerated and offers OpenGL Shaders and Textures support.
HPlayer is developped under the terms of GNU General Public License version 2.
You can find a copy of this license in the LICENSE file.


Installation from source
************************

HPlayer is build on top of
- OpenFrameworks 0.8.x ARMv6
- ofxOsc (now embedded with OF-0.8)
- ofxOMXPlayer from jvcleave
- ofxCrypto from jkosoy 
- ofxArgParser from satoruhiga


0. Setup and Update your RaspberryPi 
	* Expand filesystem
	* Split GPU memory to 128 or 256
	* Overclock if you want to
	* install and run rpi-update (https://github.com/Hexxeh/rpi-update)

1. Download / Install OpenFrameworks ARMv6 
somewhere like ~/openframeworks/ in the next steps, we'll call this path "$OF"
Instructions: http://www.openframeworks.cc/setup/raspberrypi/

2a. Clone ofxOMXPlayer from https://github.com/jvcleave/ofxOMXPlayer into $OF/addons/
> cd ~/openFrameworks/addons/ && git clone https://github.com/jvcleave/ofxOMXPlayer.git

2b. Clone ofxArgParser from https://github.com/satoruhiga/ofxArgParser into $OF/addons/
> cd ~/openFrameworks/addons/ && git clone https://github.com/satoruhiga/ofxArgParser.git

2c. Clone ofxCrypto from https://github.com/jkosoy/ofxCrypto into $OF/addons/
> cd ~/openFrameworks/addons/ && git clone https://github.com/jkosoy/ofxCrypto.git

3. Clone project HPlayer into $OF/apps/myApps/
> cd ~/openFrameworks/apps/myApps/ 
> git clone https://github.com/Hemisphere-Project/HPlayer.git

4. You are now ready to compile the player.
> cd ~/openFrameworks/apps/myApps/HPlayer
> make

5. Once it's done, you can test it with "make run"
or copy the content of the bin/ directory to your usual binary path.
use ./HPlayer to start the player


Use it!

	--out <port> 		:	Output OSC Port (default=9001)
	--base64 <0:1>			:	Enable bas64 encoding for filepath (default=0)		
	--info <0:1>		:	Display info window	(default=0)	

	--volume <0:100>	:	Volume (default=50)
	--ahdmi <0:1>		:	Use HDMI audio output	(default=0)
	--zoom <0:100>		:	Zoom out	(default=100)
	--blur <0:100>		:	Blur level	(default=0)
	
	--media <path>		:	File or Directory path for autostart
	--loop <0:1>		:	If autostarted media should loop (default=1)
	
	
	
Once started, HPlayer can be controlled with OSC commands over the network.
The available commands are:

/pause			:	Pause the video file
/resume			:	Resume the paused file
/next			:	Play the next file in the list
/prev			:	Play the previous file in the list
