- ofxOsc (now embedded with OF-0.8)
- ofxOMXPlayer from jvcleave
- ofxArgParser from satoruhiga

1. Download OpenFrameworks ARMv6 from http://openframeworks.cc/download/
and unzip it somewhere like ~/openframeworks/ in the next steps, we'll call this path "$OF"

2. Download ofxOMXPlayer from https://github.com/jvcleave/ofxOMXPlayer
and unzip it into $OF/addons/ofxOMXPlayer/

3. Download ofxArgParser from https://github.com/satoruhiga/ofxArgParser
and unzip it into $OF/addons/ofxArgParser/

4. Change directory to OF app folder and clone HPlayer repository:
cd $OF/apps/myApps/
git clone ssh://gitolite@airlab.fr:2237/HPlayer

5. You are now ready to compile the player.
If it's the first time you compile OF on your device, it can take quit a while !
cd HPlayer
make

6. Once it's done, you can test it with "make run"
or copy the content of the bin/ directory to your usual binary path.
